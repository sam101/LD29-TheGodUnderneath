LD29 : TheGodUnderneath
================

About
------

"The God Underneath" is a multiplayer survival game made in 48H for the Ludum Dare #29 challenge, with the theme "Underneath the Surface".

You must survive, digging your way to the shiny goal. But maybe the rules can change...

Everything has been written from scratch, using Node.js / express / jade / socket.io for the server size, and a simple canvas for the client side. Inspiration from the client code mainly comes from [https://github.com/cboissie cboissie]'s ludum dare entries. Buzz.js was used for the audio.
